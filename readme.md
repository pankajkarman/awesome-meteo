# Python resources to do stuffs related to atmospheric science

This curated list contains awesome open-source projects with a focus primarily on disciplines related to Atmospheric science. If you like to add or update projects, feel free to open an issue, submit a pull request, or directly edit the readme.md. Contributions are very welcome!


# Basic python

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/): A fundamental package for MATLAB like array computing in Python
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): An open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively.
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/): SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.
- [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html): It is an indispensible library for working with NetCDF, GRIB, raster, hdf and similar datasets. Xarray makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays in Python simple, efficient, and fun!

# Visualization
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html): Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- [proplot](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot): A succinct matplotlib wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics
- [Faceted](https://github.com/spencerkclark/faceted): A python library for plotting publication quality plots 
- [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/api/basemap_api.html): Plot geospatial data on map projections (with coastlines and political boundaries) using matplotlib. Note that the support for basemap in python have ended. So, it's better to switch to cartopy for visualizations on map.
- [cartopy](https://pypi.org/project/Cartopy/): Cartopy is a Python package designed to make drawing maps for data analysis and visualisation easy.
- [Holoviews](https://holoviews.org/getting_started/Gridded_Datasets.html): A library for interactive plots like D3.js in JavaScript 
- [Geoviews](https://geoviews.org/): A library for creating interactive maps. This libray makes it easy to explore and visualize geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets, such as those used in weather, climate, and remote sensing research. 
- [psyplot](https://psyplot.github.io/): Interactive Data Visualization from Python and GUIs (**especially for ICON model data**). It provides ncview like terminal interface for exploring and visualizing the geospatial data.
- [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh): Interactive Data Visualization in the browser, from Python
- [Graphviz](https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz): Simple Python interface for plotting graphs (nodes and arrows)
- [hvPlot](https://github.com/holoviz/hvplot): A high-level plotting API for pandas, dask, xarray, and networkx


# Statistics
- [statsmodel](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html): A must have library for statistical modeling and inference.
- [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn): Statistical data visualization in Python
- [Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair):  Declarative statistical visualization library for Python
